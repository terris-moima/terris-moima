<h1>Hi, I’m Terris Moima! <br/><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/terris-moima/">Aspiring Data Engineer and Analyst</a> | Passionate about Data analysis, Data Engineering & Practical Solutions></h1>

<h2>I’m currently studying Bachelor of Commerce(General-Statistics) at Nelsonn Mandela University, where I focus on the intersection of data systems, statergic business management, and statistical analysis.

I enjoy building meaningful projects that combine clean code, data-driven logic, and real-world utility. My GitHub repositories reflect work in:

Python & data analysis

SQL, R and Power BI

Tableau, Excel and Sheets

Version control (Git) and collaborative workflows

Web tools and automation scripts

Engineering problem solving

Outside academics, I founded Terry’s Rentals, a fridge rental service supporting students at Nelson Mandela University — an experience that strengthened my skills in product development, customer focus, and practical solutions.

I’m always learning, experimenting, and sharing code that helps others solve problems.
Let’s connect, contribute, and build together./<h2>
